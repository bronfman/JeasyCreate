JeasyCreate is a Javascript DOM creation framework. 


If you have a highly interactive website, with a lot of DOM creation this framework suits you well. Instead of writing four lines of code for creating an element with a class name and append to the DOM tree, like the exmaple below.

var element = document.createElement('div');
element.className = 'someClass';
var elementToAppendTo = document.getElementById('elementToAppendTo');
elementToAppendTo.appendChild(element);

With JeasyCreate, you just type a single line of code:

var element = divAppend('.someClass', '#elementToAppendTo');

The syntax is tagnameAppend('Define the elements id/classname/attribute with Jquery selector', elementToAppendTo). The elementToAppendTo could also be Jquery selector. You could also prepend / before and after to add an element to the DOM tree.

Requirements:
Jquery

That's it!
